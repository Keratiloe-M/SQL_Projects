MAJI NDOGO PART TWO

Here is a summary of what we did:
1.	Cleaning the data
•	Created an email for each employee using their names and surnames
•	Fixed the phone number format

2.	Honouring the workers
•	We were looking for the top 3 surveyors who visited water sources the most and wanted to congratulate them for their hard work.

3.	Analyzing locations
•	We were looking to compare how many records per town, province, and location type and we can see that 60% of our water sources are in rural communities across Maji Ndogo.


4.	Diving into the sources
•	We were looking at the different types of water sources, how many water sources there are across Maji Ndogo, and how many people are receiving water from each water source. We concluded that 43% of the population uses shared taps, 18% uses wells, 17% uses a tap in the home, 14% uses a broken tap in the home and 9% uses the river.

Note: The surveyors combined the data of many households together and added this as a single tap record, but each household has its tap. In addition to this, there is an average of 6 people living in a home. So 6 people actually share 1 tap (not 644). This means that 1 tap in home actually represents 644 ÷ 6 = ± 100 taps. 

5.	Start a solution
•	At some point, we will have to fix or improve all of the infrastructure, so we should start thinking about how we can make a data-driven decision on how to do it.
•	We ranked the water sources according to the number of people served, 1 being the source with the most people. This will help us figure out which source needs to be attended to first. We excluded tap in homes because it is the best water source and nothing more can be done to improve it. We saw that shared taps should be fixed first, then wells, and so on.

6.	Analyzing queues
•	We looked at how many days the survey took. We see that it took 924 days which is about 2 and half years.
•	We looked at the average waiting time in a queue. We see it look about 2 hours for people to get water.
•	We looked at the average waiting time in a queue for each day of the week. We can see that Saturday has the longest waiting time because most people are not working on Saturdays, and it may be the only day they have to get water.
•	We looked at the average waiting time in a queue for each hour of the day. We can see that the mornings and the evenings are the busiest because people collect water before and after work.

Our analysis revealed that:
1. Most water sources are rural.
2. 43% of our people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
3. 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes, but within that group, 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs.
4. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean.
5. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes.
6. In terms of queues:
- Queues are very long on Saturdays.
- Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
