Maji Ndogo: From Analysis to Action PART 1

Project Overview
This project focuses on Maji Ngogo, a fictional country that is facing a pressing water crisis. Maji Ndogo is plagued 
by water scarcity and water quality issues. We have collected a vast amount of data (over 60,000 records) through the hard 
work of engineers, biologists, chemists, field surveyors, IT technicians, and analysts.

This dataset contains crucial information about water sources, pollution levels, employee activities, projects undergoing
on these water sources and more. Our task is to analyze this dataset, clean the dataset, uncover hidden patterns, and extract 
insights that will guide actionable solutions to enhance water services in Maji Ndogo.

There are four parts of this project and in this part 1 we will focus on data cleaning, which includes addressing inconsistencies and
errors within the dataset.

Data Overview

The data collected is structured into several tables, each focusing on different aspects of the water survey:

employee: Information about employees involved in data collection.
global_water_access: Global water access statistics by country and region and year.
location: Details about various water source locations within Maji Ndogo.
visits: Records of visits to water sources.
water_quality: Data on the quality of water sources.
water_source: Information about different types of water sources.
well_pollution: Pollution test results for wells.
data_dictionary: Information on columns in each table, the description of each database, and the data type of each column
